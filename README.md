### Simple Console Coffee Machine

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

It reads one line from the standard input, which can be "buy", "fill", or "take". 
- If you want to `buy` some coffee, input "buy". 
- If you are a special worker and you think that it is time to `fill` up all the supplies for the coffee machine, input "fill". 
- If you are another special worker and it is time to `take` the money from the coffee machine, input "take".
- if you want to exit the system, input "exit".
